Your craving is not in vain for there is a place matching exactly that description! Situated in East Singhbhum district of Jharkhand, the town of Ghatshila has the winding rivulets and serene waterfalls of Ranchi while also harbouring ample sites of religious worship and a rich multicultural heritage that Kolkata does.

                <P>Located on the Parasnath Hill, the highest mountain in the state of Jharkhand, in an inland part of rural east India, of the Giridih district of Jharkhand, Shikharji is one of the holiest pilgrimage sites for Jains. It is believed that here is where twenty of the twenty-four Jain Tirthankaras had attained moksha (in other words, freedom from the cycle of rebirth), along with several other monks which makes it one of the most important and holy sites for Jain Tirthas. Shikharji rises to a height of 1,350 m thus making it the highest mountain in the state.Not only does the religious sentiments cause pilgrims to make the perilous journey to the mountain temple, but also the gorgeous inlaid work on the walls of the temples and the murals present there. There are several inscriptions in Sanskrit that makes it beautiful.

                    Apart from the beauty and serenity the mountain temple provides, tourists may also enjoy adventure sports such as paragliding and parasailing. The section between the summit of the mountain and the Gandharva Nala stream is a very religious and holy place for Jains. The idol present in the main temple dates back to the 18th century even if some portions of the temple is relatively newly constructed.</P>

It is best known for the sunrise and sunset views it offers, especially during summers.
