        <p>Mizoram, state of India. It is located in the northeastern part of the country and is bounded by Myanmar (Burma) to the east and south and Bangladesh to the west and by the states of Tripura to the northwest, Assam to the north, and Manipur to the northeast. The capital is Aizawl, in the north-central part of the state.

            Mizoram (“Land of the Mizos”) was known as the Lushai Hills District of Assam before it was renamed the Mizo Hills District in 1954. In 1972 it became a centrally administered union territory under the name of Mizoram, and in 1987 it achieved statehood. Area 8,139 square miles (21,081 square km). Pop. (2011) 1,091,014.Geologically, the Mizo Hills form a part of the Rakhine (Arakan) Mountains, a series of compact parallel ridges with a north-south axis formed of sandstone, limestone, and shales—all Cenozoic rocks between 2.6 and 65 million years old. The ridges, separated by narrow river valleys, rise to about 7,000 feet (2,100 metres). In the south, the Kaladan River and its tributaries flow southward into Myanmar, while the Dhaleswari (Tlawng) and Sonai (Tuirail) rivers flow north into Assam.The climate in Mizoram is moderate. During the coolest months (November through February), temperatures in Aizawl typically rise from the low 50s (low 10s C) into the high 60s F (about 20 °C) daily. In the warmest months (June through August), minimum temperatures are in the high 60s F, while maximum temperatures usually peak in the mid-80s F (about 30 °C). Rainfall averages about 100 inches (2,500 mm) annually, with most brought by the southwest monsoon (which blows from May to September).</p>

This picturesque and peaceful city also commands exotic landscape of verdant hills stretching away to the horizon. Aizawl literally means “a field of wild cardamom", a name which originated during the days of the great Mizo chiefs Lalsavunga and Thanruma who had set up villages in and around the present site of Raj Bhavan in the early nineteenth century. </P>
