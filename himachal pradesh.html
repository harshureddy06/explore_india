        <H1 >-HIMACHAL PRADESH-</H1>

        <p>Himachal Pradesh is a state in the northern part of India. Situated in the Western Himalayas, it is one of the thirteen mountain states and is characterized by an extreme landscape featuring several peaks and extensive river systems. Himachal Pradesh is the northernmost state of India and shares borders with the union territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh to the north, and the state of Punjab to the west, Haryana to the southwest, Uttarakhand to the southeast and a very narrow border with Uttar Pradesh to the south. The state also shares an international border to the east with the Tibet Autonomous Region in China. Himachal Pradesh is also known as Dev Bhoomi, meaning 'Land of Gods' and Veer Bhoomi which means 'Land of the Brave'.

            The predominantly mountainous region comprising the present-day Himachal Pradesh has been inhabited since pre-historic times having witnessed multiple waves of human migrations from other areas.Through its history, the region was mostly ruled by local kingdoms some of which accepted the suzerainty of larger empires. Prior to India's independence from the British, Himachal comprised the hilly regions of Punjab Province of British India. After independence, many of the hilly territories were organized as the Chief Commissioner's province of Himachal Pradesh which later became a union territory. In 1966, hilly areas of neighboring Punjab state were merged into Himachal and it was ultimately granted full statehood in 1971.
            
            Himachal Pradesh is spread across valleys with many perennial rivers flowing through them. Around 90% of the state's population lives in rural areas. Agriculture, horticulture, hydropower and tourism are important constituents of the state's economy. The hilly state is almost universally electrified with 99.5% of the households having electricity as of 2016. The state was declared India's second open-defecation-free state in 2016. According to a survey of CMS – India Corruption Study 2017, Himachal Pradesh is India's least corrupt state.

            <ul><li><b>MANALI</b></li>
                <img src="manali.jpg" alt="picture" width="90" height="140"><br>
            <P>One of the most popular hill stations in Himachal, Manali offers the most magnificent views of the Pir Panjal and the Dhauladhar ranges covered with snow for most parts of the year. 

                With the Covid-19 pandemic going on, Manali has evolved to be a place loved by young people looking for longer stays for workation. With ambient cafes, good wifi availability, small eateries and convenient shops, Old Manali is among the favorite neighbourhood for such people. There are many homestays and hostels offering dorm beds for cheap for longer durations. 
                
                Manali has many trekking options around it, making it a great base for exploring this side of Himalayas. River Beas provides great rafting options in the nearby town of Kullu. Adjoining Parvati river, lies the Parvati Valley with  Kasol, Manikaran, Tosh and small villages attracting travellers for longer stays.</P>
            <LI><B>KASOL</B></LI>
            <img src="kasol.jpg" alt="picture" width="90" height="140"><br>
            <P>Kasol is a quaint little village in Himachal situated along the banks of the river Parvati. Commonly known as the 'Amsterdam of India', Kasol is a tourist attraction that is rapidly gaining fame as a popular hub for trekkers, backpackers, and nature lovers. Kasol is situated 23 kms from Bhuntar and next to the religious town of Manikaran and is one of the best places in the country just to sit back and chill in the panorama of snow-clad mountains, pine trees and gurgling river.

                Kasol is famous for its trekking trails, which include treks to Kheerganga, Yanker Pass, Sar Pass, and Pin Parbati Pass. To get a real feel of the culture in this region, go on a visit to the village of Malana. Located a few kilometres away from Kasol, Malana is a tiny hamlet inhabited by people living in self-imposed isolation. The people of Malana claim themselves to be Aryan descendants, as a result of which they avoid interaction with outsiders. The village has plenty of scenic sights, though, and is often called ‘Little Greece’.</P>
            <LI><B>SHIMLA</B></LI>
            <img src="shimla.jpg" alt="picture" width="90" height="140"><br>
            <P>Shimla is the capital of Himachal Pradesh and a popular hill-station among Indian families and honeymooners. Situated at the height of 2200m, Shimla was the summer capital of British India. Shimla still retains its old-world charm with beautiful colonial architecture, pedestrian-friendly Mall Road and the ridge lined up with multiple shops, cafes and restaurants.

                Shimla is well connected with many cities and is just 4 hours from the nearby city of Chandigarh. The city has an airport as well; however, there aren't many daily flights from here. The railway station connects Shimla with the plans and is famous for the Kalka-Shimla train route; a UNESCO listed World Heritage site.
                
                The weather is pleasant for most of the months with tourists flocking especially during the summer months. The winters are cold with some days of snow from mid-December till February end.</P>

            <img src="jibhi.jpg" alt="picture" width="90" height="140"><br>
            <P>Often referred to as a mesmerising "hamlet" situated amidst the lush green forests and surrounded by variegated mountains, Jibhi is located in the Tirthan Valley of Himachal Pradesh. The dense pine forests, tranquil freshwater lakes and pristine temples make this place worth visiting. You will be spellbound after visiting this place and would not want to leave it. The cosy Victorian-style cottages in which you can stay are an added bonus that makes you feel as if you are living in the Victorian Period. So enjoy a cup of chai while listening to the sweet chirpings of the birds in the lap of nature.Nestled in the peaks of northern Himalayas lies the Jalori mountain pass, located between the districts of Kullu and Shimla. Perhaps one would recognise it better as the snow-covered summit in the Bollywood film "Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani", where actors Ranbir Kapoor and Deepika Padukone are seen trekking through the mountainside. The pass opens in the second week of March and shuts down in December due to snowfall.</P>

Popular attractions here include Christ Church, Central Research Institute, Monkey Temple, and Sunset Point.
