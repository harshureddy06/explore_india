        <p>West Bengal  is a state in the eastern region of India along the Bay of Bengal. With over 91 million inhabitants, it is the fourth-most populous state and the thirteenth-largest state by area in India. Covering an area of 88,752 km2 (34,267 sq mi), it is also the eighth-most populous country subdivision of the world. Part of the Bengal region of the Indian subcontinent, it borders Bangladesh in the east, and Nepal and Bhutan in the north. It also borders the Indian states of Odisha, Jharkhand, Bihar, Sikkim and Assam.

            The state capital is Kolkata, the third-largest metropolis, and seventh largest city by population in India. West Bengal includes the Darjeeling Himalayan hill region, the Ganges delta, the Rarh region, the coastal Sundarbans and the Bay of Bengal. The state's main ethnic group are the Bengalis, with the Bengali Hindus forming the demographic majority.
            
            The area's early history featured a succession of Indian empires, internal squabbling, and a tussle between Hinduism and Buddhism for dominance. Ancient Bengal was the site of several major Janapadas, while the earliest cities date back to the Vedic period. The region was part of several ancient pan−Indian empires, including the Vangas, Mauryans, and the Guptas. The citadel of Gauḍa served as the capital of the Gauḍa Kingdom, the Pala Empire, and the Sena Empire. Islam was introduced through trade with the Abbasid Caliphate, but following the Ghurid conquests led by Bakhtiyar Khalji and the establishment of the Delhi Sultanate, the Muslim faith spread across the entire Bengal region. During the Bengal Sultanate, the territory was a major trading nation in the world, and was often referred by the Europeans as the "richest country to trade with". It was absorbed into the Mughal Empire in 1576. Simultaneously, some parts of the region were ruled by several Hindu states, and Baro-Bhuyan landlords, and part of it was briefly overrun by the Suri Empire. Following the death of Emperor Aurangzeb in the early 1700s, the proto-industrialised Mughal Bengal became a semi-independent state under the Nawabs of Bengal, and showed signs of the first Industrial revolution.[7][8] The region was later conquered by the British East India Company at the Battle of Plassey in 1757 and became part of the Bengal Presidency.[9][10]
            
            The region was a hotbed of the Indian independence movement and has remained one of India's great artistic and intellectual centres. Following widespread religious violence, the Bengal Legislative Council and the Bengal Legislative Assembly voted on the Partition of Bengal in 1947 along religious lines into two independent dominions: West Bengal, a Hindu-majority Indian state, and East Bengal, a Muslim-majority province of Pakistan which later became the independent Bangladesh.</p>

                <img src="kol.jpg" alt="picture" width="90" height="140"><br>
                <P>Kolkata, India's second biggest city, is a perpetually ongoing festival of human existence, concurrently luxurious and squalid, refined and frantic, pointedly futuristic, while beautifully in decay. A vibrant 350-year-old metropolis located on India's Eastern Coast, the capital of West Bengal thrives on contradictions and imposing spectacles; nothing is commonplace in this city. Famously known as the City of Joy, Kolkata is, in every sense, the artistic, cultural and intellectual capital of the country. Kolkata's streets are vivid, hectic, chaotic, and yet, brimming with life and creativity. Driven by the indomitable spirit of the self-made middle class, the city has created a beautiful juxtaposition of the old colonial-era charm with the nascent upcoming hipster culture that thrives amongst the city's millennial residents.

                    Starting from admiring the flourishing art scene in the city to going on rewarding gastronomical explorations to wandering amidst the countless bazaars to sitting by the banks of the Hooghly and enjoying a peaceful sunset, Kolkata is soaked in layers and layers of heritage and culture, and peeling off each layer to look beneath the hood is a very rewarding, once-in-a-lifetime experience. As the famous quote goes, "If you want a city with a soul, come to Calcutta".</P>

                <img src="dar.jpg" alt="picture" width="90" height="140"><br>

Located in West Bengal, this scenic hill station is the perfect getaway for a romantic honeymoon. Nestled amidst acres of tea plantations, Darjeeling stands at the height of 2,050 meters above sea level, thus boasting a cool climate all year round.

                    The toy train established back in 1881 is conferred the title of World Heritage Status by UNESCO. The train begins its journey from the plains and rises to over 2000 metres above sea level, offering breathtaking views of the mountains as it chugs along.
                    
                    Over 86 tea estates in Darjeeling are responsible for producing the worldwide famous 'Darjeeling Tea'. Have a cup of locally brewed chai at the tea estate, or get down amidst the plantations to pluck a few tea leaves yourself; you are free to take your pick!

                <P>Known for hosting the biggest mangrove forests in the world, Sundarbans National Park is located around 110 Km south of Kolkata in West Bengal, India. It is also a Tiger Reserve and a Biosphere Reserve famous for being the home of the Royal Bengal tigers, among others, including roaring rivers and beautiful estuaries. Sundarbans National Park is a part of the Sundarban delta, which extends into Bangladesh. It is a UNESCO world heritage site with a large variety of birds and animal species, including reptiles such as salt-water crocodiles.

                    Shared between India and Bangladesh, the Sundarbans meaning beautiful forest, was declared a UNESCO heritage site in 1984. This area has a quiet charm that amazes visitors with the simplicity and uniqueness of its ecological balance despite offering habitat to some of the most dynamic and awe-inspiring flora and fauna. These forests are, in fact, the last remaining stands of the mighty jungles which once covered the Gangetic plains. Since 1966, the Sundarbans have been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that there are over 400 Royal Bengal Tigers residing in it.
                    
                    This forest has the largest number of Sundari trees. Sundarbans epitomize wilderness with its meandering rivers, springs, creeks and estuaries. It was a declared Tiger Reserve, home to the Royal Bengal Tiger - an almost extinct species that swim in the saline water and are often called man-eaters.

                <P>Situated in the Jalpaiguri and Siliguri districts of West Bengal, Siliguri is a city known as the Gateway to North-East India. Located 560 kms from Kolkata to the north, Siliguri is the twin city of Jalpaiguri and the third largest in West Bengal. Siliguri has its own international airport which serves mainly as a base for tourists to camp in before moving out to explore nearby tourist attractions such as Kalimpong, Darjeeling, Gangtok and Bhutan. However, Siliguri itself is a perfectly good holiday destination, with sufficient things to see and do. Over the years, Siliguri has become famous for its products such as tea and timber and also an important commercial and connecting hub.

                    The Jaldapara National Park, situated on the banks of the Torsa river, is a prime attraction of Siliguri. Earlier known as the Jaldapara Wildlife Sanctuary, the park is spread over an area of around 215 kilometres, and is comprised of riverine forests as well as grasslands. The park is famous for its impressive population of Royal Bengal Tigers, elephants, one-horned rhinoceros, and various other species of deer. To get the best out of the park, you can go for an elephant ride, which will give you a chance to catch a glimpse of the animals up close.</P>

                <P>Located on the banks of a huge lake, the hill town of Mirik adds to North Bengal's bounty. Amidst the Himalayan Valley, Mirik has more to offer than just beautiful mountains and lakes.

                    From boating experiences for your romantic getaway to temples for the faithful to orchids and gardens for the nature's child, West Bengal tourism is incomplete without Mirik. The well populated, yet not over crowded town also offers viewpoints for those quiet moments of introspection and traditional Indian Bazaars to splurge. Going to Mirik for the perfect hill station getaway is an idea you'll never go wrong in.</P>

                <P>Starting from river Teesta in the East to river Sankoshi in the west, Dooars is a local name given to the floodplains of North-East India around Bhutan. The name 'Dooars' has emerged from 'door' as Dooars is the gateway to Bhutan.

                    Dooars comprises of several towns and districts in this region including Jalpaiguri, Darjeeling, Siliguri, etc. Geographically, Dooars is blessed with such brilliance in its relief, imagine, the mighty range of mountains of the Eastern Himalayas in the backdrop, a band of thick forests, rich in species of Flora and Fauna, continued with tea gardens, and cut here and there by water body. Somewhere in the middle of all this is Dooars. The gateway you wouldn't want to cross heartlessly.</P>
