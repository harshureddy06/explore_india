        <H1 >-GUJARAT-</H1>
        <p>Gujarat is a state along the western coast of India. Its coastline of about 1,600 km (990 mi) is the longest in the country, most of which lies on the Kathiawar peninsula. Gujarat is the fifth-largest Indian state by area, covering some 196,024 km2 (75,685 sq mi); and the ninth-most populous state, with a population of 60.4 million. It is bordered by Rajasthan to the northeast, Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu to the south, Maharashtra to the southeast, Madhya Pradesh to the east, and the Arabian Sea and the Pakistani province of Sindh to the west. Gujarat's capital city is Gandhinagar, while its largest city is Ahmedabad. The Gujaratis are indigenous to the state and their language, Gujarati, is the state's official language.

            The state encompasses 23 sites of the ancient Indus Valley civilisation (more than any other state). The most important sites are Lothal (the world's first dry dock), Dholavira (the fifth largest site), and Gola Dhoro (where 5 uncommon seals were found). Lothal is believed to have been one of the world's first seaports.</p>
           
           
<h3>TOURIST PLACES TO VISIT IN GUJARAT:</h3>
<ul>
    <li><b> RANI KI VAV (THE QUEEN'S STEPWELL),PATAN</b></li>
    <img src="rani.jpg" alt="picture" width="90" height="140"><br>
    <p>Rani ki Vav is an ancient abandoned stepwell dating back to the 11th century and UNESCO World Heritage Site. It was also constructed during the Solanki dynasty, apparently in memory of ruler Bhimdev I, by his widowed wife. The stepwell has stairs going down seven levels, and panels containing more than 500 main sculptures and over 1,000 minor ones. Only discovered relatively recently, the stepwell was flooded by the nearby Saraswati River and silted over until the late 1980s. When it was excavated by the Archeological Survey of India, its carvings were found in pristine condition.</p>
    <li><b>SIDHPUR</b></li>
    <img src="sidhpur.jpg" alt="picture" width="90" height="140"><br>
    <P>A town trapped in time, Sidhpur will delight architecture aficionados with its colorful century-old mansions belonging to the affluent Dawoodi Bohra Muslim community. Many of the houses are empty as their owners have moved abroad. Sidhpur sits alongside the holy Saraswati River and is also a Hindu pilgrim destination. It's dotted with temples and water bodies. The ruins of 10th century Rudra Mahalaya Temple, with its towering carved pillars and torans, is a major attraction.</P>
    <li><b>SUN TEMPLE, MODHERA</b></li>
    <img src="sun.jpg" alt="picture" width="90" height="140"><br>

It's a substantial structure, consisting of a carved stepped tank, assembly hall, and main shrine. It's covered in intricate stone sculptures. The sanctum is positioned in a way that it receives the first rays of the morning sun at the equinox.</P>

    <img src="chhota.jpg" alt="picture" width="90" height="140"><br>
    <P>Part of Gujarat's tribal belt, Chhota Udepur is ideally visited during the Holi festival when tribal fairs erupt into life throughout the district. Tribal markets also take place there on Saturdays and Mondays. If you're interested in India's tribal heritage, don't miss Bhasha Research and Publication Center's Adivasi Academy in Tejgadh village of Chhota Udepur. Its incredible Vaacha Museum of Voice documents tribes from across the country. It has a comprehensive collection including musical instruments, paintings, sculptures, textiles, images of worship, and agricultural equipment.

    <img src="statue.jpg" alt="picture" width="90" height="140"><br>
    <P>The world's tallest statue, dedicated to Indian independence activist Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel (1875â€“1950), was completed in 2018. At 182 meters tall, it's twice the size of the Statue of Liberty. Patel was the first Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister of independent India, and is highly regarded for his leadership in bringing the 562 princely states of India together. The area around the statue has been developed as a comprehensive tourist destination for the whole family to enjoy, with enough activities and attractions to fill in at least three days. Apart from the statue, these include a sound and laser show, butterfly garden, cactus garden, Ayurvedic wellness center, eco-friendly and medicinal plant nursery, handicraft stores, valley of flowers, forest with native trees, children's park with train and mirror maze, safari park and zoo, zip-lining, white water rafting, cycling, and boating on the lake. </P>

    <img src="dwarka.jpg" alt="picture" width="90" height="140"><br>
    <P>One of the four most sacred Char Dham Hindu pilgrimage sites and seven most ancient Sapta Puri religious cities in India, Dwarka is considered to be the ancient kingdom of Lord Krishna and the first capital of Gujarat. The Krishna Janmashtami festival is a major event there. Of special importance is Dwarkadhish Temple, built approximately 200 BC and often referred to as Jagat Mandir. Head down to Gomti Ghat, at the holy water's edge, for a spectacle of decorated camels, tea stalls, and seashell jewelry sellers. Just north of Dwarka, Shivrajpur beach was recently awarded international Blue Flag certification for safety and cleanliness.</P>
    <LI><B>SOMNATH</B></LI>
    <img src="Somanath.jpg" alt="picture" width="90" height="140"><br>
    <P>An important pilgrimage destination, Somnath Temple is one of the 12 jyotirlinga (shrines of Lord Shiva, where he's worshiped as a linga of light) in India. Its seaside location is powerful, the intricate carvings on its sandstone architecture are superb, and its history is fascinating. The temple was ransacked by Islamic invaders and rebuilt numerous times, with the final reconstruction taking place after India achieved independence from the British. Maha Shivratri is celebrated in a big way there in February or March. A colorful religious fair is also held every year on Kartik Purnima (full moon night, usually in November), complete with small children dressed up as Lord Shiva and plenty of bhaang.</P>
